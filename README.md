# belly-button-challenge


The Belly Button Challenge put advanced data visualization techniques into practice, utilizing JavaScript and HTML. The project was guided by experts (copied below) and attempted to use cutting-edge methods to generate meaningful visualizations from difficult datasets. The challenge was aimed to test innovative ways of data processing and visualization, as well as to push the boundaries of current technologies in this sector.
