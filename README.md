# belly-button-challenge


The Belly Button Challenge put advanced data visualization techniques into practice, utilizing JavaScript and HTML. The project was guided by experts (copied below) and attempted to use cutting-edge methods to generate meaningful visualizations from difficult datasets. The challenge was aimed to test innovative ways of data processing and visualization, as well as to push the boundaries of current technologies in this sector.


**Introduction:**

In this challenge, we use the URL, which is provided by the class: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json 


**What Are the Main Tasks?**


Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
* Use (sample_values) as the values for the bar chart.
* Use (otu_ids) as the labels for the bar chart.
* Use (otu_labels) as the (hovertext) for the chart.
Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Use (otu_ids) for the x values.
* Use (sample_values) for the y values.
* Use (sample_values) for the marker size.
* Use (otu_ids) for the marker colors.
* Use (otu_labels) for the text values.
Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
* Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
